If you want to **master two-pointers deeply**, you need volume + structured layering.

Below is an **expanded Two-Pointers Master Sheet (80+ problems)** structured phase-wise from foundation → elite interview level.

This is NOT random. It builds skill progressively.

# 🧠 MASTERING STRATEGY

## Step 1: Solve Phase 1–2 completely

These are the real fundamentals.

## Step 2: Phase 3 carefully

Write invariants for every problem.

## Step 3: Phase 4 fast/slow technique until automatic.

## Step 4: Redo 3Sum and Trapping Rain Water multiple times.

# 🧠 DECISION CHECK (VERY IMPORTANT)

When you see a problem ask:

| Question                     | If Yes                  |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Is array sorted?             | Try two ends            |
| Is it subarray constraint?   | Expand/shrink           |
| Linked list?                 | Fast/slow               |
| Need in-place rearrangement? | Multi-pointer partition |
| Counting pairs?              | Sort + two pointers     |
