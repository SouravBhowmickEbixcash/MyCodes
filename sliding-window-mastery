43. LC 2958 — Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency
44. LC 2841 — Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray
45. LC 2537 — Count the Number of Good Subarrays
46. LC 2302 — Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K
47. LC 2516 — Take K of Each Character From Left and Right
48. LC 2762 — Continuous Subarrays
49. LC 2799 — Count Complete Subarrays in an Array
50. LC 2953 — Count Complete Substrings

**What you master here:**

* Multi-constraint windows
* Hybrid techniques
* FAANG-level questions

# How You Should Execute This Sheet (IMPORTANT)

## Rule 1

Do each problem:

* 20–30 min attempt
* If stuck → Hint only
* Then re-code without seeing solution

---

## Rule 2

After each phase:

* Re-solve 2 random problems from previous phase

---

## Rule 3 (MOST POWERFUL)

Keep a notebook:

For each problem write:

* Window invariant
* When to shrink
* What to count

---

# Realistic Timeline

If done seriously:

* Phase 1–2 → 4–5 days
* Phase 3 → 1 week
* Phase 4–5 → 1 week
* Phase 6–7 → 1–2 weeks

Total mastery: **~3 weeks**

---

# My Honest Suggestion (Based on your questions so far)

You are already comfortable with:

* Stack
* Two pointers
* Window basics

If you complete **Problems 16–24 + 25–28** properly
→ Your sliding window skill will jump massively.

---

## Next (VERY POWERFUL)

If you want, I can now create:

### **“Sliding Window Pattern Notebook”**

A **one-page cheat sheet** containing:

* All templates
* All formulas
* All decision rules
* Common mistakes

Or

### A **daily 14-day schedule** using these 50 problems.

Which one do you want next?
